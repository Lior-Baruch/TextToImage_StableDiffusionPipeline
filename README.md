# TextToImage_StableDiffusionPipeline
TextToImage_StableDiffusionPipeline is a program that generates images based on given prompts using the StableDiffusionPipeline from the diffusers package. The program loads a pre-trained model, sets the device to be used (either "cuda" if available or "cpu"), generates an image based on a given prompt, and then generates multiple images based on a list of prompts. The generated images are plotted using the matplotlib library.

# Getting Started
**Prerequisites**
Python 3.7 or later
PyTorch
diffusers
matplotlib

# Examples
**Here are some example prompts that you can use to generate images:**

"a picture of a cat"
"a picture of a dog"
"a picture of a person"
"a picture of a car"
"a picture of a house"
"a picture of a tree"
"a picture of a flower"

"a picture of a fish"
"a picture of a mountain"
"a picture of a lake"
"a picture of a river"
"a picture of a sunset"
"a picture of a sunrise"
"a picture of a rainbow"
"a picture of a cloud"
"a picture of a storm"
"a picture of a lightning"
"a picture of a snowflake"
